# FACETS.app

## Version 5.x (2022-02-19)

This version tries to match the latest version used by MSK-Biostats. In particular the new pileup and the latest version of the FACETS package with its support of unmatched normals.

Also uses the method from Biostats to pick the _best_ unmatched normal if a matched normal is not available.

usage::
```bash

usage:: FACETS.app/run.sh [--tag TAG] TUMORBAM NORMALBAM

```
